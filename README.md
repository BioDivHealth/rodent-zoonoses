# Ecological predictors of zoonotic infection in wild rodent populations

## Harry Gordon*, Ana Martinez-Checa*, Gregory Milne, David Redding, David Simons

## Project summary

This project seeks to understand the ecological drivers of infection of wild rodents with arenaviruses & hantaviruses. It seeks to do so by collating from the scientific literature a global dataset of paired infection prevalences & rodent abundances. These data will then be used to understand how spatially & temporally varying ecological processes - such as changes in habitat suitability - influence rodent infection risk. Ultimately, this work hopes to improve understanding of the relationship between global ecological changes and the risk of zoonotic spillover into human populations.
