# Ecological predictors of zoonotic infection in wild rodent populations

## Harry Gordon, Ana Martinez-Checa, Gregory Milne, David Redding

## Project summary
This project seeks to understand the ecological drivers of infection of wild rodents with arenaviruses & hantaviruses. It seeks to do so by collating from the scientific literature a global dataset of paired infection prevalences & rodent abundances. These data will then be used to understand how spatially & temporally varying ecological processes - such as changes in habitat suitability - influence rodent infection risk. Ultimately, this work hopes to improve understanding of the relationship between global ecological changes and the risk of zoonotic spillover into human populations.

## Work in progress
### :wrench: Task list:
- Add ana data to data folder + update datasets
- Write better README file :white_check_mark:
- Start writing manuscript intro/methods
- Add citations from data used and useful citations to Zotero
- Find way to host GLC files online that can interface with R
- Add interesting plots/infographics to Rmarkdown manuscript
- Improve existing plots and figures (in folder) to publishable quality
- Write script for GLC around coordinates
- Check extracted studies for inclusion
- Continue with extraction
- Find literature for rodent home ranges
- Find literature for rodent community turnover
